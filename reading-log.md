# Reading Log

This is a log of books I've read. The idea is to keep track of books I liked or disliked and when I last read them, in case I want to re-read them later. I started it in 2021 so it's definitely not complete.

I read non-linearly and with no obligation to finish a book, just like if books were Twitter. (I mean, think about it: books are the original social media.) I just pick up any book I feel like reading on that day and start reading the parts that seem interesting. If a book is boring, I just drop it. I have a lot of books that I haven't read yet and maybe I never will. I don't care. The point of a personal library is to have plenty of books to choose from so you actually get excited enough to grab a book and read. (Anyone who's visited a public library knows this feeling.) What's the value of having a library where you've read every book? That's just storage for old paper.

Each year is split in two categories:

* **Cover-to-cover**: Books I read cover-to-cover. (Except the Foreword. I never read the fucking Foreword; if it had actually useful information the author would have written it himself and made it part of the book. The Foreword is the equivalent of a skippable YouTube ad, basically.)
* **Partially read**: Books I've only partially read so far. Maybe I read a few chapters, maybe I'm still reading them, maybe I have no plans on ever finishing them.

## 2021

### Cover-to-cover

* [The Black Swan - Nassim Taleb](https://amzn.to/3lOmvYE): 5/5. Life-changing.
* [Economics in One Lesson - Henry Hazlitt](https://amzn.to/3AB58AC): 4/5. This should be a mandatory read for every high school student.
* [The Dao of Capital - Mark Spitznagel](https://amzn.to/2XHEXu9): 4/5.
* [Fooled by Randomness - Nassim Taleb](https://amzn.to/3ELcZOu): 4/5.
* [Safe Haven - Mark Spitznagel](https://amzn.to/2ZoJCBB): 4/5.
* [That Which is Seen and That Which is Not Seen - Frederic Bastiat](https://amzn.to/3CwU5ZO): 4/5.
* [The Big Short - Michael Lewis](https://amzn.to/39tyaq5): 4/5.
* [How an Economy Grows and Why It Crashes](https://amzn.to/3ktvKy2): 4/5.
* [Tail Risk Hedging - Vineer Bhansali](https://amzn.to/3u1Va97): 3/5.
* [Computer Graphics from Scratch - Gabriel Gambetta](https://amzn.to/39ttsIR): 4/5. Super fun little book!

### Partially Read

* [Basic Economics - Thomas Sowell](https://amzn.to/3u1vWYm): 5/5. Amazing. Thomas Sowell might be one of the greatest minds of our time.
* [The Linux Programming Interface - Michael Kerrisk](https://amzn.to/2XGZ8Ig): 5/5.
* [Letters from a Stoic - Lucius Annaeus Seneca](https://amzn.to/3hXtYna): 4/5.
* [CrazyBusy - Edward Hallowell](https://amzn.to/3kyo5hU). Haven't made my mind about a rating yet.
* [The Children of Men - P.D. James](https://amzn.to/3AMNSZD): 4/5. Great so far!
* [Alice's Adventures in Wonderland - Lewis Carroll](https://amzn.to/3AyfP73): 3/5.
* [Sleep Smarter - Shawn Stevenson](https://amzn.to/3u2DxpG): 3/5.
* [Burnout - Herbert Freudenberger](https://amzn.to/3zxdmsu): Haven't made my mind about a rating yet.
* [Architecture: Form, Space & Order - Francis D. K. Ching](https://amzn.to/2XICe2U): Haven't made my mind about a rating yet.
* [Game Programming Patterns - Robert Nystrom](https://amzn.to/39qv9qC): 2.5/5. I expected this to be a bit more interesting, honestly.
* [Graphic Shaders - Mike Bailey & Steve Cunningham](https://amzn.to/3kv3MC3): 4/5. I've only read a few chapters so far but I'm liking it.
* [Algorithms on Strings - Maxime Crochemore](https://amzn.to/3ksRtGh): 3/5. The data structures are beautiful but this guy has the most confusing notation ever and explaining things clearly is definitely not one of his strengths.
* [Jewels of Stringology - Maxime Crochemore & Wojciech Rytter](https://amzn.to/39ua6na): 3/5.
* [Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess - Bobby Fischer](https://amzn.to/39sODuu): 3/5.
* [Game Engine Black Book: Wolfenstein 3D - Fabien Sanglard](https://amzn.to/3zyXYMa): 4.5/5. This is ended up being much more interesting than I expected.
* [Sapiens - Yuval Noah Harari](https://amzn.to/3u1dgrX): 2/5. The content is interesting but the humanity-hating tone of the author just ruins it for me. This guy really seems to hate humans. I don't think I'll be able to stomach finishing it.
* [Greenlights - Matthew McConaughey](https://amzn.to/3u78aKz): 1/5. Absolute garbage. Seems like a book actually written by a Hollywood actor. I don't know what I was expecting.
