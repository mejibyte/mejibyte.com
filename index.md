My name is **Andrés Mejía**. I’m a **Software Engineer** who’s been playing with these things called computers since I was 10, when my father gave me one for Christmas. (It was a 300 MHz Pentium II with 64MB of RAM — the fastest on the market at the time.)

I got into programming as an early teenager when a friend showed me a program called [NetBus](/images/netbus.gif). It allowed you to remotely open your friend's CD-ROM tray and other funny pranks. I was so fascinated with the idea that I started researching online and several months later I had taught myself Delphi/Pascal and was able to write a piece of malware that I could call my own!

You can find my open source contributions on [GitHub](https://github.com/mejibyte), but since I joined my current company I've been laser-focused on my job so there's not much recent activity.

You can reach me via email at [andr@esmejia.com](mailto:andr@esmejia.com) or via Twitter at [@mejibyte](https://twitter.com/mejibyte).
