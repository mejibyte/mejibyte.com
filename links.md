## Personal websites

* [swtch.com/~rsc/](https://swtch.com/~rsc/) and [research.swtch.com](https://research.swtch.com): Russ Cox is an amazingly smart guy and I really enjoy his methodical, careful writing.
* [stallman.org](https://stallman.org/): Richard Stallman is a legend and his website is a classic. I trully admire this guy's ability to stand his ground. Read [RMS lifestyle](https://stallman.org/rms-lifestyle.html) to see what I mean.  My favorite part of his website is his "What's bad about..." series (e.g. [What's bad about Facebook](https://stallman.org/facebook.html)).
